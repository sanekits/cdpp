# make-kit.mk for cdpp
#  This makefile is included by the root shellkit Makefile
#  It defines values that are kit-specific.
#  You should edit it and keep it source-controlled.

# The shellkit/ tooling naturally evolves out from under the dependent kits.  ShellkitSetupVers allows
# detecting the need for refresh of templates/* derived files.  To bump the root version, 
# zap all templates/* containing 'ShellkitTemplateVers' constants and changes to the corresponding dependent kits
# Note that within templates/* there may be diverse versions in upstream shellkit, they don't all have to match,
# but the derived copies should be sync'ed with upstream as needed.
ShellkitTemplateVers=2

# TODO: update kit_depends to include anything which
#   might require the kit version to change as seen
#   by the user -- i.e. the files that get installed,
#   or anything which generates those files.
