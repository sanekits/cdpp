# This file is sourced during interactive shell initialization. It's the
#  right place to initialize CDPATH.  Recommendations:
#    1.  CDPATH should start with ".:" so that the current dir is included.
#    2.  Adding HOME next is almost always helpful for normal users
#    3.  Any dir which contains many projects is a candidate as well.
#    4.  Don't add too much.  Auto-complete becomes less effective.  Rely on
#        the `tox` indexing feature to drill into lower-order subdirs.
#    5.  Add temporary dirs with `cdpath_add`: these will not survive a shell restart,
#        but are handy for project-specific tweaks.
#    6.  Windows+WSL users might consider adding /c/Users/<WindowsUserName>, so that
#         Downloads & Pictures, etc are close at hand
