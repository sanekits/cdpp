# This file is sourced during interactive shell initialization. It's the
#  right place to initialize CDPATH.  Recommendations:
#
#   Help stuff:
#    Read the docs: https://github.com/sanekits/cdpp#readme
#
#   Basic stuff:
#
#    1.  CDPATH should start with ".:" so that the current dir is included.
#    2.  Adding HOME next is almost always helpful for normal users
#    3.  Any dir which contains many projects is a candidate as well.
#    4.  Don't add too much.  Auto-complete becomes less effective.  Rely on
#        the dir indexing feature of cdpp to drill into lower-level subdirs.
#
#   Advanced stuff:
#    5.  Add temporary dirs with `cdpath_add`: these will not survive a shell restart,
#        but are handy for project-specific tweaks.
#    6.  WSL users might consider adding /c/Users/<WindowsUserName>, so that
#         Downloads & Pictures, etc are close at hand
#
#   Problem stuff:
#    7.  TAB-COMPLETION TOO SLOW?? Remove elements from $CDPATH_INIT in ~/.cdpprc, one at
#        a time, until you get the right balance.  (re-init your shell on each attempt
#        with "exec bash")
#
